# LWC-Metadata
**My LWC Metadata component** gives on-hand details of all **Apex Classes, Trigger, Visualforce Pages** and its Component on a single click with the **search option** for the user's org. 
This metadata component also allows viewing the body of triggers or classes by clicking the **view** option.
Please refer to the demo gif.
